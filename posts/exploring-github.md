Sometimes you see something that catches your eye and you have to find out more. This is what happened when I saw the Github page for [Thomas Anderson](https://github.com/Driminary/thomas-anderson.net). I saw a beautiful sketch of his web site architecture, shown below in all its glory, a [2.4MB PNG file](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/7677813a6330d6426339ae2b9959603ea5703e1ceebfff0aa105ae5f332fdc42/68747470733a2f2f692e6962622e636f2f3046543870784d2f6172636869746563747572652e706e67).

It was made with [excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com), which I had never heard of before. What I liked about it was the casual, almost manual sketch appearance. It reminded me of a [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com) theme I saw called Theme UI Sketchy Preset [Theme UI Sketchy Preset](https://github.com/beerose/theme-ui-sketchy).

That's all I got.
