   Jump on over to the creater of this blog's theme and [read](https://www.industrialempathy.com/posts/image-optimizations) about the wizardy that makes sure you get the right size and quality pictures for every brand of smart phone/computer. You would not want to download a 6MB image with dimensions of 2400x2450 for example on a phone. The code that this blog is built on will only send a small file to an iPhone wile sending a large image to a desktop.
  Amazing stuff.
