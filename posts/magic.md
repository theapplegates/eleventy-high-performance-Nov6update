I've been in awe of Max's [web site](https://mxb.dev) for some time. The way he designs is magical to those who don't develop. It reminds me of the famous Arthur C. Clarke quote.
> "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.‚Äù

Each time he [tweets](https://twitter.com/mxbck) about something new I quickly jump over to check it out and maybe you should as well. As an example check out his new creation, [Medium](https://medium.com) like text sharing. Copy some text and the share menu appears. Not too bad for a static site. While I am here singing the praises of his development skills you should check out his creation of analytics for [Webmentions](https://indieweb.org/Webmention).
That's all I wanted to say.
