Some maybe thinking that this site is poorly designed, with black and yellow main colors. There is a reason for this design madness.
The site uses the Bahunya CSS framework, and they choose black and yellow for a very specific reason. You eyes might thank you someday.


> Why does Bahunya use white text on a dark background? Recent extensive [German opthamology research](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-28904-x) concluded that reading dark text on a light background thins the [choroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choroid), the vascular layer of the eye, contributing to myopia, while reading light text on a dark background increases the thickness of the choroid. As such, Bahunya ships with dark text on a bright background for opthamological safety, but feel free to change it.
